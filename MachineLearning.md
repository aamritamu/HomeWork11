## Machine Learning outcome
#### Resampling 

1. Which model has the best balanced accuracy score?

Answer-

Naive Random Oversampling - 0.6612700484668286

SMOTE Oversampling - 0.6303296388959394

Cluster Centroid - 0.522132379306316

SMOTEENN - 0.6191516492016873

Models which use oversampling better then undersampling, and out of two oversampling the best is Naive Random Oversampling.

2. Which model had the best recall score?

Answer-

Naive Random Oversampling - 0.67

SMOTE Oversampling - 0.64

Cluster Centroid - 0.41

SMOTEENN - 0.54

In this case too oversample performed well with highest value of Naive Random Oversampling compare to other four modes.

3. Which model had the best geometric mean score?

Answer-

Naive Random Oversampling - 0.66

SMOTE Oversampling - 0.63

Cluster Centroid - 0.51

SMOTEENN - 0.61

Similary Naive Random Oversampling has highest mean score.

Comparing all the scores and results, it seems model has better prediction when it is oversample rather then undersample
